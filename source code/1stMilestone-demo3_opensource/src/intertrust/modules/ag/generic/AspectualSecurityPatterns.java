 * This component represents a list of aspectual security patterns

 * When needed, these components and connections will be parameterized in
 * order to specify the list of possible joinpoints in terms of the application components and
 * connections. 
 * This information is part of the input to this module, it is mainly defined at design
 * time; it must be specified independently from the AOP framework used to weave the aspects,
 * and it depends on the applications using the INTER-TRUST framework.
